    "storyText": "Nata-Nord Tallinn started in 2025, inspired by a love for baking and a desire to bring the taste of Portugal to Estonia. Founded by a Portuguese native living in Tallinn, it all began with a simple idea: to share the traditional pastel de nata with the local community.\n\nWhat began as a small kitchen project quickly grew as more people discovered and loved our pastries. Using a family recipe and fresh ingredients, we bake every nata with care and pride.\n\nToday, Nata-Nord is a little slice of Portugal in the heart of Tallinn — sharing warm, flaky natas and a passion for good food.",
